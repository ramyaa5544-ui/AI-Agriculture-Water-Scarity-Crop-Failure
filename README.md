# AI-Agriculture-Water-Scarcity

## Problem Statement
Farmers face severe crop losses due to unpredictable water scarcity, irregular rainfall,
and climate change. There is a lack of data-driven tools that can predict water stress
conditions and provide early warnings to reduce crop failure risks.

## Solution
We propose an AI-based agriculture support system that predicts water scarcity and
crop failure using historical weather data, soil parameters, and agricultural trends.
The system helps farmers and stakeholders make informed irrigation and crop planning decisions.

## Key Features (Phase-1 MVP)
- Water scarcity prediction
- Crop failure risk analysis
- Data-driven decision support
- Early warning alerts (prototype)
- Visualization of risk factors

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Machine Learning
- Pandas & NumPy
- Weather and agricultural datasets
- GitHub (Version Control)

## Architecture Overview
Data Sources → Preprocessing → ML Model → Risk Prediction → Farmer Insights

## MVP Scope
Phase-1 focuses on a functional prototype demonstrating prediction logic and
system workflow. Advanced real-time data integration and mobile app deployment
are planned for future phases.

## Future Scope
- IoT-based soil moisture sensors
- Real-time weather API integration
- Mobile application for farmers
- Government advisory system integration
- Multi-crop and regional expansion
